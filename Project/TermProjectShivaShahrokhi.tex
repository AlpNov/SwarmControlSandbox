\begin{abstract}

Micro- and nanorobots can be built in large numbers, but generating independent control inputs for each robot is prohibitively difficult.  Instead, micro- and nanorobots are often controlled by a global field. In our previous work, inspired by human operators, we investigated controllers that use only the mean and variance of a robot swarm. We proved that the mean position is controllable, then provided conditions under which variance is controllable.  We next derived automatic controllers for these and a hybrid, hysteresis-based switching control to regulate the first two moments of the robot distribution. In this work, we considered is if we had some maps like Fig.~\ref{fig:covariance}, how we can control covariance of the robots. We use friction to break the symmetry of the robots and make the covariance desired.

\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Using global control of a swarm }

Micro- and nano robots are often controlled by global-broadcast signal. Some examples are MagMite microrobots with different resonant frequencies controlled by a global magnetic field \cite{Frutiger2008},
%using an external magnetic source to guid cluster of paramagnetic micro particles to achieve point to point positioning of the cluster \cite{Khalil2013},
using a common input to control large populations of simple robots with at least one obstacle \cite{AaronManipulation2013}, light-driven nanocars, which synthetic molecules actuated by a specific wavelength of light \cite{TourNanocar2012}, scratch-drive microrobots, actuated and controlled by a DC voltage signal from a substrate\cite{Donald2006,Donald2008}, When human controls large number of robots, lots of limitations appears, like the number of robots that a human can control simultaneously. To remove this limitation, using global input to all the robots would be sufficient.

\subsection{Human user studies}

Our previous work used an online game named ``SwarmControl.net'' with human user interfaces for controlling large number of simulated robots \cite{swarmcontrol2013}. It is done this way because previous studies on real robots were not scalable because of the cost of the robots. Humans could complete the tasks designed in this platform like pushing a block from somewhere to a goal position which is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:swarmcontrol.net}. This platform enabled us to have large number of human players all over the world to play.

\subsection{Automatic controllers}

In our previous work for block pushing task, one surprising result was that humans with less information played better. Inspired by this work, we proved that we can control mean and variance of the swarm and with just knowing mean and variance, we could have auto controllers which could complete the block pushing task but with some limitations. Our algorithm could not handle difficult maps, because the swarm might fell apart and it could get stuck in some corners. One problem is that if there is just a narrow corridor and we should pass that corridor, we can not control the shape of a swarm to enable them to pass through that. Therefore, it is not enough to control mean and variance of the swarm, and if we could control covariance of the swarm in respect to \emph{x} and \emph{y} axis, controlling the shape of the swarm in any angle would be possible. So our next goal is controlling covariance of the swarm in a 2D plane.

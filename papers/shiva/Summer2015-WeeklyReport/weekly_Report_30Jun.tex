\section{My \emph{Objectives} this week}
\begin{itemize}
\item Completing Simulation for 2 robots infinite friction algorithm
\item Running go to the light on kilobots
\end{itemize}



\section{My \emph{Accomplishments} this week}

\subsection{\emph{Kilobots}}

\begin{itemize}
\item I calibrated some robots to see their movements, and tried some programs on them.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{\emph{Algorithms}}

\begin{itemize}
\item I fixed the algorithm in x dimension, I wrote some loops for two way running, but it hasn't worked properly yet, I have written the y dimension also, but it is sometimes buggy, I try to fix this until the end of today and submit the newer version to the github. Current code is submitted to the github. 
\end{itemize}





\section{My \emph{Plan} for next week}

\begin{itemize}
\item Completing the algorithm for 2 robots.
\item Start working with Arduino and programming the light bulbs.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Meeting with Dr. Becker  }

\begin{itemize}
\item What to do for more than two robots? What is our goal next?
\end{itemize}

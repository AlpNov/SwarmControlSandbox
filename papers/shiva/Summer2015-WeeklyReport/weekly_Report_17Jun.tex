\section{My \emph{Objectives} this week}
\begin{itemize}
\item Loading windows on my Macbook
\item Running Kilobots with windows
\item Writing and simulating the algorithm of setting positions for two robots
\item Adding a folder for Journal version of our IROS papers
\end{itemize}


\section{Two Robots Positioning}\label{sec:algorithm}


\subsection{Controlling Covariance}

In this algorithm we want to control two position of two robots using friction. For ease of proof, we assume that we want to \emph{x} position of the robots, and \emph{y} of the robots are not the same and will remain the initial $\Delta y $ as we go through the algorithm.
\begin{algorithm}
\caption{Getting desired X-space}\label{alg:CovarianceControl}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\Require Knowledge of the starting and ending positions  of the two robots $s_1$ (topper robot) \& $s_2$ (lower robot)  \& $e_1$ (topper robot) \& $e_2$ (lower robot) and $L$ length of the bottom wall. Current position of the robot will be showed as $r$.
%\Input Global velocity of robots (unless they touch side)
%\Assume $\Delta y \neq 0$ 
\Ensure $\Delta y(t) = \delta y(0)$ 
%\Assume $max(s_{1y} , s_{2y}) < L - \epsilon $
\State $e_{1x} - e_{2x} = \Delta e_x$
\State $s_{1x} - s_{2x} = \Delta s_x$
\Loop

\If {$\Delta x >= 0$ \emph{AND} $\Delta e > 0$}
\While  {$L - r_2 > \Delta e$}
\State Go left
\EndWhile

\State Go down until lower robot touch bottom wall
\If {$\Delta e < \Delta x$}
\State Go left until $\Delta e = \Delta x$
\Else Go right until $\Delta e = \Delta x$
\EndIf
\State Go to desired position
\EndIf

\If {$\Delta x >= 0$ \emph{AND} $\Delta e < 0$}
\While  {$r_2 < \|\Delta e\| $}
\State Go right
\EndWhile
\If {$r_2 = L$ \emph{OR} $r_1 = L$}
\State Go $\epsilon$ left 
\EndIf
\State Go down until lower robot touch bottom wall
\State Go right until $\Delta e = \Delta x$
\State Go to desired position
\EndIf

\If {$\Delta x < 0$ \emph{AND} $\Delta e < 0$}
\While  {$r_2 > \|\Delta e\|$}
\State Go right
\EndWhile
\State Go down until lower robot touch bottom wall
\If {$\|\Delta e\| < \|\Delta x\|$}
\State Go right until $\|\Delta e\| = \|\Delta x\|$
\Else Go left until $\|\Delta e\| = \|\Delta x\|$
\EndIf
\State Go to desired position
\EndIf
\newpage
\If {$\Delta x < 0$ \emph{AND} $\Delta e > 0$}
\While  {$L < \Delta e + r_2 $}
\State Go left
\EndWhile
\If {$r_2 = L$ \emph{OR} $r_1 = L$}
\State Go $\epsilon$ left 
\EndIf
\State Go down until lower robot touch bottom wall
\State Go right until $\Delta e = \Delta x$
\State Go to desired position
\EndIf

\EndLoop

\end{algorithm}


\section{My \emph{Accomplishments} this week}

\subsection{\emph{Kilobots}}

\begin{itemize}
\item I installed windows on my machine, and was able to see robots moving around and also communicating with each other.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{\emph{Algorithms}}

\begin{itemize}
\item I wrote the algorithm with latex which works with all the possible positions that the robots may see.
\end{itemize}





\section{My \emph{Plan} for next week}

\begin{itemize}
\item Complete the algorithm with Mathematica
\item Trying to go to the light by installing Kilobotics platform.(Now our robots don't understand their libraries because of the k-team platform.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Meeting with Dr. Becker  }

\begin{itemize}
\item To see if my algorithm work and getting comments out of it.
\end{itemize}

\end{document}

@article{AaronManipulation2013,
	Abstract = {Roboticists, biologists, and chemists are now producing large populations of simple robots, but controlling large populations of robots with limited capabilities is difficult, due to communication and onboard-computation constraints. Direct human control of large populations seems even more challenging.

In this paper we investigate control of mobile robots that move in a 2D workspace using three different system models. We focus on a model that uses broadcast control inputs specified in the global reference frame.

In an obstacle-free workspace this system model is uncontrollable because it has only two controllable degrees of freedom---all robots receive the same inputs and move uniformly. We prove that adding a single obstacle can make the system controllable, for any number of robots. We provide a position control algorithm, and demonstrate through extensive testing with human subjects that many manipulation tasks can be reliably completed, even by novice users, under this system model, with performance benefits compared to the alternate models.

We compare the sensing, computation, communication, time, and bandwidth costs for all three system models. Results are validated with extensive simulations and hardware experiments using over 100 robots.},

	Abstract = {We use a cluster of paramagnetic microparticles to
carry out a wireless two-dimensional microassembly operation.
A magnetic-based manipulation system is used to control the
motion of the cluster under the influence of the applied magnetic
fields. Wireless motion control of the cluster is implemented at
an average velocity and maximum position tracking error of
144 microm/s and 50 microm, respectively. This control is used to achieve
point-to-point positioning of the cluster, manipulation of microobjects,
and assembly of microobjects into a microstructure.
The control system achieves stable positioning of the cluster,
while simultaneously compensating for the planar drag forces
on the cluster and the microobject. The presented magneticbased
microassembly technique allows for the selective pushing
and pulling of microobjects with specific geometries towards
their destinations inside a microstructure in an execution time
of 18 s, within a workspace of 1.8 mm x 2.4 mm.},

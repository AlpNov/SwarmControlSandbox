	Abstract = {Controlling a large team of mobile agents with a global (uniform) input is a challenging problem since all agents are affected by the same control value at a given time. This problem rises particularly in small scale mobile robotics, where agents are controlled by global stimuli responses like magne- totaxis. In this paper, motivated by a particular experimental implementation, we consider a swarm of magnetized Dubins vehicles moving in a workspace in which the magnitude and orientation of a magnetic field can be varied in time, but not in space. We show that a control strategy that switches on and off a rotating magnetic field can globally asymptotically stabilize the swarm to desired ``essential'' features. We show how this strategy can be further tuned to increase the convergence rate and to achieve desired swarming behaviors such as navigation in environments with obstacles.},

@conference{Lewis2012,
	Abstract = {In this paper we investigate principles of swarm control that enable a human operator to exert influence on and control large swarms of robots. We present two principles, coined selection and beacon control, that differ with respect to their temporal and spatial persistence. The former requires active selection of groups of robots while the latter exerts a passive influence on nearby robots. Both principles are implemented in a testbed in which operators exert influence on a robot swarm by switching between a set of behaviors ranging from trivial behaviors up to distributed autonomous algorithms. Performance is tested in a series of complex foraging tasks in environments with different obstacles ranging from open to cluttered and structured. The robotic swarm has only local communication and sensing capabilities with the number of robots ranging from 50 to 200. Experiments with human operators utilizing either selection or beacon control are compared with each other and to a simple autonomous swarm with regard to performance, adaptation to complex environments, and scalability to larger swarms. Our results show superior performance of autonomous swarms in open environments, of selection control in complex environments, and indicate a potential for scaling beacon control to larger swarms.},

	Abstract = {In this paper, we investigate what role the network topology plays when controlling a network of mobile robots. This is a question of key importance in the emerging area of human- swarm interaction and we approach this question by letting a human user inject control signals at a single leader-node, which are then propagated throughout the network. Based on a user study, it is found that some topologies are more amenable to human control than others, which can be inter- preted in terms of the rank of the controllability matrix of the underlying network dynamics, as well as, measures of node centrality on the leader of the network.},

@inproceedings{Goodrich2012,
	Abstract = {This paper uses simulations to identify what types of human influence are afforded by the flocking and swarming structures that emerge from Couzin's bio-inspired model. The goal is to allow a human to influence a decentralized agent collective without resorting to centralized human control. Evidence is provided that, when nominal agents use switching-based control to respond to human-guided predators and leaders, the resulting behavior is responsive to human input but is obtained at the cost of causing the dynamic structure of the collective to follow a single flocking structure. Leaders are more effective in influencing coherent flocks, but predators can be used to divide the flock into sub-flocks, yielding higher performance on some problems. Introducing a so-called ""stakeholder"" leadership style makes it possible for a human to guide the agents while maintaining several different types of structures; doing so requires more than one human-controlled agent. We then demonstrate that it is possible to produce potentially useful emergent dynamics without centralized human control, and identify an important type of emergent dynamics: automatic switches between structure types.},

@article{TourNanocar2012,
	Abstract = {A second generation motorized nanocar was designed, synthesized, and imaged. To verify structural integrity, NMR-based COSY, NOESY, DEPT, HSQC, and HMBC experiments were conducted on the intermediate motor. All signals in 1H NMR were unambiguously assigned, and the results were consistent with the helical structure of the motor. The nanocar was deposited on a Cu(111) surface, and single intact molecules were imaged by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) at 5.7 K, thereby paving the way for future single-molecule studies of this motorized nanocar atop planar substrates.},

	Abstract = {Micro- and nanorobotics have the potential to revolutionize many applications including targeted material de- livery, assembly, and surgery. The same properties that promise breakthrough solutions---small size and large populations--- present unique challenges to generating controlled motion. We want to use large swarms of robots to perform manipula- tion tasks; unfortunately, human-swarm interaction studies as conducted today are limited in sample size, are difficult to reproduce, and are prone to hardware failures. We present an alternative.
This paper examines the perils, pitfalls, and possibilities we discovered by launching SwarmControl.net, an online game where players steer swarms of up to 500 robots to complete manipulation challenges. We record statistics from thousands of players, and use the game to explore aspects of large- population robot control. We present the game framework as a new, open-source tool for large-scale user experiments. Our results have potential applications in human control of micro- and nanorobots, supply insight for automatic controllers, and provide a template for large online robotic research experiments.},

@inproceedings{AaronManipulation2013,
	Abstract = {Roboticists, biologists, and chemists are now producing large populations of simple robots, but controlling large populations of robots with limited capabilities is difficult, due to communication and onboard-computation constraints. Direct human control of large populations seems even more challenging.

In this paper we investigate control of mobile robots that move in a 2D workspace using three different system models. We focus on a model that uses broadcast control inputs specified in the global reference frame.

In an obstacle-free workspace this system model is uncontrollable because it has only two controllable degrees of freedom---all robots receive the same inputs and move uniformly. We prove that adding a single obstacle can make the system controllable, for any number of robots. We provide a position control algorithm, and demonstrate through extensive testing with human subjects that many manipulation tasks can be reliably completed, even by novice users, under this system model, with performance benefits compared to the alternate models.

We compare the sensing, computation, communication, time, and bandwidth costs for all three system models. Results are validated with extensive simulations and hardware experiments using over 100 robots.},

	Abstract = {We use a cluster of paramagnetic microparticles to
carry out a wireless two-dimensional microassembly operation.
A magnetic-based manipulation system is used to control the
motion of the cluster under the influence of the applied magnetic
fields. Wireless motion control of the cluster is implemented at
an average velocity and maximum position tracking error of
144 microm/s and 50 microm, respectively. This control is used to achieve
point-to-point positioning of the cluster, manipulation of microobjects,
and assembly of microobjects into a microstructure.
The control system achieves stable positioning of the cluster,
while simultaneously compensating for the planar drag forces
on the cluster and the microobject. The presented magneticbased
microassembly technique allows for the selective pushing
and pulling of microobjects with specific geometries towards
their destinations inside a microstructure in an execution time
of 18 s, within a workspace of 1.8 mm x 2.4 mm.},

\section{Block-Pushing Results}\label{sec:expResults}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The experimental section compares the results of our hysteresis-based controller applied to a \emph{block-pushing} task.  In preliminary work over 1000 human users completed this task using varying levels of feedback. To our surprise, users who received the lowest amount of feedback -- just the moments of the position distribution of the robot swarm -- performed better than users with full state feedback.
 The original experiment explored manipulation with varying amounts of sensing information: {\bf full-state} sensing provides the most information by showing the position of all robots; {\bf convex-hull} draws a convex hull around the outermost robots; {\bf mean} provides the average position of the population; and {\bf mean + variance} adds a confidence ellipse. Fig.~\ref{fig:Visualization} shows screenshots of the same robot swarm with each type of visual feedback. Full-state requires $2n$ data points for $n$ robots. Convex-hull requires at worst $2n$, but usually a smaller number.  Mean requires two, and variance three, data points.  Mean and mean + variance are convenient even with millions of robots. Our hypothesis predicted a steady decay in performance as the amount of visual feedback decreased.

To our surprise, our experiment indicated the opposite: players  with just the mean completed the task faster than those with full-state feedback.  As Fig.~\ref{fig:ResVaryVis} shows, the levels of feedback arranged by increasing completion time are [mean + variance, mean, full-state, convex-hull].  Anecdotal evidence from beta-testers who played the game suggests that tracking 100 robots is overwhelming---similar to schooling phenomenons that confuse predators---while working with just the mean + variance is like using a ``spongy'' manipulator. Our beta-testers found convex-hull feedback confusing and irritating.  A single robot left behind an obstacle will stretch the entire hull, obscuring the majority of the swarm.

\subsection{Automated Block Pushing}

To solve this problem, we discretized the environment.  On this discretized grid we used breadth-first search to determine $M$, the shortest path from any point for the block to the goal, and generated a gradient map $\nabla \mathbf{M}$ toward the goal as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:BFSGradient}.  The blocks's center of mass is at $\mathbf{b}$ and has radius $r_b$. The robots were then directed to assemble at  $\mathbf{b} - r_b \nabla \mathbf{M}$ to push the block toward the goal location.

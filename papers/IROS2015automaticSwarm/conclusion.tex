Sensing is expensive, especially on the nanoscale. To see nanocars~\cite{Chiang2011}, scientists fasten molecules that fluoresce light when activated by a strong light source. Unfortunately, multiple exposures can destroy these molecules, a process called \emph{photobleaching}. Photobleaching can be minimized by lowering the excitation light intensity, but this increases the probability of missed detections~\cite{Cazes2001}. A control methodology based on statistics of the robot swarm rather than the actual position of each robot, allows relaxing demands on imagine systems, controllers robust to tracking errors, and a simpler methodology.  In this work we...

%Photobleaching is caused by the irreversible destruction of fluorophores due to either the prolonged exposure to the excitation source or exposure to high-intensity excitation light. Photobleaching can be minimized or avoided by exposing the fluor(s) to the lowest possible level of excitation light intensity for the shortest length of time that still yields the best signal detection; this requires optimization of the detection method using high sensitivity CCD cameras, high numerical aperture objective and/or the widest bandpass emission filter(s) available. Other approaches include using fluorophores that are more photostable than traditional fluorophores and/or using antifade reagents to protect the fluor(s) against photobleaching. Steps to avoid photobleaching are not feasible for all detection methods and should be optimized for each method used. For example, antifade reagents are toxic to live cells, and therefore they can only be used with fixed cells or tissue. Furthermore, some detection methods, such as flow cytometry, normally do not require steps to avoid photobleaching because of the extremely short exposure time of the fluorophore to the excitation source.

% Simulation:
%%  Mean control results   (image and plot(s) )
%%  Variance Control      (image and plot(s) )
%%  Hybrid control   (image and plot(s) )

\subsection{Controlling the mean position}

give PID control law, explain experiment (number of robots, maximum speed, ).

contrast controllers -- as is typical with PID control laws, we can tune the response to meet desired specifications.

image showing varying the number of robots n % is this needed?


\subsection{Controlling the variance}

cite the control law, explain experiment (number of robots, maximum speed, ).

contrast controllers -- as is typical with PID control laws, we can tune the response to meet desired specifications.

\subsection{Hysteresis Control of mean and variance}

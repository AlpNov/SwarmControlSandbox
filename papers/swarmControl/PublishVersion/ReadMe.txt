======DESCRIPTION============================================================
 Video attachment for “Stochastic Swarm Control with Global Inputs“ by Shiva Shahrokhi and Aaron T. Becker, at the University of Houston. 

Micro- and nano-robots are usually controlled by “global inputs”, where all robots receive the same control inputs. Video shows how the mean and variance of the robot’s position are controlled with global inputs. First: to show that the mean position is controllable, the mean position of the swarm traces the word “swarm”. Second: the swarm variance is regulated by wall collisions while the mean position is also controlled. Last: demonstration of a block-pushing experiment, using our hybrid hysteresis mean and variance controller.

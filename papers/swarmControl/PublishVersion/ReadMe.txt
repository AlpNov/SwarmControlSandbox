======DESCRIPTION============================================================
 Video attachment for “Stochastic Swarm Control with Global Inputs“ by Shiva Shahrokhi and Aaron Becker, at University of Houston. 

 Video shows how the mean and variance of the robots are controlled with global inputs. First part the mean position of the swarm writes the word “swarm” to show that the mean position is controllable. Second part tries to keep the variance constant by moving to the wall if it is getting bigger than desired while its mean position is also controlled. Finally at the third part, the block pushing experience which uses a hybrid hysteresis mean and variance control is shown.

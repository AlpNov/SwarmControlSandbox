\subsection{Controlling Torque}

One of the features of an object is its orientation. When a swarm is manipulating an non-symmetric object, in narrow corridors orientation matters. We can control orientation by controlling torque of the object. Equation ~\ref{eq:torque} shows the parameters that we should control.

\begin{equation}
\tau = F \times d\label{eq:torque}
\end{equation}
where d

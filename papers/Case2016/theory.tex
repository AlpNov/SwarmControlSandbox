\subsection{Controlling Torque}

One of the features of an object is its orientation. When a swarm is manipulating a non-symmetric object, in narrow corridors orientation matters. We can control orientation by controlling torque of the object. Equation ~\ref{eq:torque} shows the parameters that we should control.

\begin{equation}
\tau = F \times r\label{eq:torque}
\end{equation}
Where $F$ is the force that each touching robot make and $r$ is the vector from that robot to the center of mass of the object. Because
